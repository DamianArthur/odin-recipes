        <p>Everyone’s got their own go-to scone recipe. Whether it’s one passed down through generations in a hand-written book, or one you’ve bookmarked and used for years, we all seem to have an opinion on what makes a great scone.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="square">500g self raising flour</li>
            <li>250ml chilled lemonade</li>
            <li>300ml thickened cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 220C and line baking tray with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a large bowl and make well in centre. Pour in lemonade and 1 cup of cream. Use a flat knife to stir until soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead gently for 30 seconds until smooth. Press into 3cm disc. Use 5cm pastry cutter to cut 20 scones. Place scones on prepared tray.</li>
            <li>Bake for 16-18 minutes until scones are risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</li>
